				<div class="content">
					<p>
						I'm Ivan Skorupan, a full stack engineer and solution architect living in Amsterdam. Originally from Zagreb, I’ve spent the past several years helping startups grow their products, their people, and their technical foundations.
					</p>

					<p>
						My journey in tech has taken me through frontend frameworks, backend systems, team leadership, and shaping UI libraries used across entire companies. I enjoy bridging the gap between product and engineering — making sure things not only work, but make sense.
					</p>

					<p>
						After leading teams and helping scale a company through multiple growth phases, I relocated to the Netherlands to deepen my technical career in a new environment. I’m currently focused on solving real problems, writing occasionally, and exploring what a sustainable, meaningful life in tech looks like.
					</p>

						Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Zagreb, with a strong foundation in software engineering, algorithms, and system design. I've continued learning on the job — from architectural decisions to mentoring teams and navigating product growth.
