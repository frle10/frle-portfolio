## Project Overview

> "Behind every smooth website is a well-structured system keeping everything in sync."

This was a passion project I worked on in my free time for KK Dinamo Zagreb, one of Croatia’s professional basketball clubs. The goal was to modernize the club’s online presence with a dynamic backend — replacing manual updates and scattered content with a single, robust admin system.

The frontend was handled by collaborators, while I focused entirely on designing and building the backend infrastructure that powers the live site.
