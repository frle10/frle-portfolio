## Project Overview

> “You never forget your first live app.”

Toodoo was the first real app I designed, built, and deployed completely on my own — a lightweight to-do list tool made with vanilla technologies. It allowed users to create, edit, organize, and filter tasks across different categories, all inside a responsive and intuitive UI.

While it didn’t reinvent the wheel, Toodoo played a key role in helping me learn the fundamentals of full stack development and gave me a huge confidence boost early in my career.

## What It Did

### ✅ Core features:

- Add/edit/delete tasks
- Group tasks into color-coded categories
- Filter and search through tasks
- Mark tasks complete or archive them
- Data persisted via localStorage

### 🖥️ UI highlights:

- Fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Smooth animations for task transitions
- Clean UX with a minimal visual identity

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid), JavaScript (ES6+)
- **State management:** Vanilla JS with modular pattern
- **Persistence:** Browser localStorage
- **Build tooling:** None — hand-rolled and manually structured

## What I Learned

Toodoo taught me far more than just how to build an app. I learned:

- How to break down features into components and data models
- The importance of UI/UX details and accessibility
- How to troubleshoot bugs, manage versions, and deploy publicly
- That finishing and shipping is a skill in itself

Looking back, it’s a humble app — but it was a crucial step in becoming a confident and self-directed developer.

#### Status

The app remained online for a few years and was used by friends, colleagues, and early testers. It’s no longer maintained, but I still look back on it proudly as the beginning of my builder’s mindset.
