## The Idea

> ‚ÄúGood education should be accessible and personal ‚Äî no matter where you start from.‚Äù

InstruGo was born from a simple need: helping students find the right instructors quickly and reliably. Whether they‚Äôre looking for help with math in primary school or exam prep at university level, the goal was to build a platform that made it easy to search, compare, and book tutors with minimal friction.

As someone passionate about both education and engineering, I wanted this to feel less like a job board and more like a modern product marketplace ‚Äî with verified profiles, smart filters, and a smooth booking flow.

## My Role

I designed and built InstruGo from the ground up, including:

- Frontend in **React + TypeScript**
- Backend in **Node.js** with **Express**
- **MongoDB** as a flexible database layer
- Authentication with **JWT + bcrypt**
- File/image upload and profile management
- Booking logic with availability tracking and calendar sync
- Admin dashboard for content moderation and platform control

I also ran user testing sessions with real students and instructors to refine the flows before launch.

## Key Features

### üîç Smart search & filters

Users can search instructors by subject, education level, location, availability, and hourly rate.

### üìÖ Booking & scheduling

Time slots are synced with instructors‚Äô availability and bookings can be managed in-app.

### üßæ Profiles & ratings

Each instructor has a profile with bio, credentials, availability, and student reviews.

### üõ°Ô∏è Secure messaging & account system

Students and instructors can message each other directly while keeping personal info safe.

## Lessons & Reflections

This project taught me a lot about building user-facing products from both a **technical** and **strategic** perspective. I had to think about platform trust, smooth UX, and maintaining flexibility for future verticals (e.g., test prep, group classes, etc.).

It also deepened my understanding of architecture for multi-user systems, including permission roles, resource ownership, and secure communication.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, SCSS Modules
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Infra:** Heroku (prototype), Cloudinary for media, SendGrid for notifications
- **Other:** JWT, bcrypt, GitHub Actions for basic CI

---

## Status

The prototype is live in a closed beta and being used by a test group of students and instructors. The next steps include payment integration and user-driven content features.

#### Key Takeaways

- Building a real product‚Äîeven without full funding‚Äîcan be a powerful learning experience.
- Listening to users early helped me avoid overbuilding.
- Managing both product and tech taught me how much architecture is about tradeoffs and people, not just code.
