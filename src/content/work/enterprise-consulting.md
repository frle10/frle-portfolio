## Project Overview

> "True enterprise solutions aren't just about code; they're about building resilient systems that align with long-term business strategy."

In my consulting work, I've partnered with several large-scale enterprise companies to help them break free from legacy monoliths and embrace modern, cloud-native technologies. This project represents a synthesis of that experience, focusing on a major digital transformation initiative.

The core challenge was to design a new, scalable platform architecture that could integrate with existing internal systems while providing a foundation for future growth. My role was a blend of hands-on engineering and strategic consulting ‚Äî leading technical design, mentoring client teams, and ensuring the solution aligned with key business objectives.

## Key Capabilities

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Architecture & Migration

I designed and implemented a multi-stage migration strategy to move critical services to a scalable, resilient cloud environment on AWS, minimizing downtime and risk.

### üß© Microservice & API Design

The monolithic backend was deconstructed into a series of independent microservices communicating via gRPC and REST APIs. This improved development velocity and fault tolerance.

### üöÄ DevOps & CI/CD Automation

I established a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Terraform (Infrastructure as Code) to automate testing, provisioning, and deployment, reducing manual errors by over 90%.

### ü§ù Stakeholder Alignment & Strategy

A key part of the role involved running technical workshops, creating architectural decision records (ADRs), and presenting technical roadmaps to both engineering teams and executive stakeholders to ensure alignment across the organization.
